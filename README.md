# Mushrooms
Notebook + Streamlit App on the UCI Mushrooms dataset

This is a project where I build a model on a mushrooms dataset from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom). The goal of this dataset is to classify mushrooms in edible or toxic category.
The Notebook is in french.
I have build a streamlit app form the deployment of the best model. This app is in english. For launching the app, install streamlit et run the command: streamlit run webapp.py.
